This is a static page project I've done before, which uses some basic html, css, JS and jQuery operations, 
including flex layout, display, hide, button animation and irregular triangular arrows. 
The layUi front-end framework is also used to make the development simple and convenient.
It is very useful for beginners of front-end development.
